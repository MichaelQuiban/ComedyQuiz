  "body": "Your next project in this lesson is to build an interactive quiz app from scratch. Like you did with your shopping list app in Unit 2, you'll tackle this assignment in three steps. First, in this assignment, you'll review the requirements for the app, and then you'll need to design and wireframe your app. Next you'll create a static version of the app, so you can focus on HTML and CSS. Finally, you'll bring the app to life with the JavaScript. ",
